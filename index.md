# Site of the Ehus

*Note: We teddy bears are made up (of course). This is a childhood fantasy of our existence and imaginary place.*

## Food

We love Golden Chocolate Ehus. They resemble us, so we love ourselves. They're expensive though, so we just eat *ordinary* Chocolate Ehus most of the time.

## History

There is a world called Ehu World with two lands called Ehuland, which is our land, and Ehaland. You know what that means... right?

We Ehus are the good guys, and Ehas are the bad guys. Ehus control the world, since the *good guys always win*. Nah... we just take advantage of them :D. They're not bad; we just hate them for no reason.

## Clothing

We have a common dress, which is to always wear blue pajamas and a blue Santa hat. Christmas wear is our attire.

Ehas do not have a common dress. Christmas wear is also their attire, unfortunately.

## Adoption

A total of 4 Ehus have been adopted (bought) from the crossroads of Ehu World and the real world (Walmart in this case).

One Eha has escaped to the real world from some event (a gift from a teacher in elementary).

## Name

We really don't know how we got our names.

One thing to note is that our leader didn't have a secret name (i.e. online or IGN) of their own. They've been influenced by their sibling to combine our names and part of their name to create Joehu.
